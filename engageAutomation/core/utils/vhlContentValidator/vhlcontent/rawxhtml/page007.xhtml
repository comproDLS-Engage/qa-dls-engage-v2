<strong>Don&#x0027;t Pay for DNA Testing; Have Some FUN Instead!</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>by <span class="author">Pierre Bernard</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="paranum">1</span> Did you know that genes carry your identity in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)? But my identity is not only in my genes. It&#x0027;s made up of my experiences with family, friends, and strangers. It is shaped by what I&#x0027;ve seen, heard, and felt. My identity is not just my DNA.</p>
<p>
<span class="paranum">2</span> DNA testing is a billion-dollar industry. The number of people who have taken DNA tests quadrupled between 2015 and 2021.</p>
<p>
<span class="paranum">3</span> DNA test companies promise that people can use DNA tests to discover their heritage. But I don&#x0027;t think the tests are worth it. Perhaps it&#x0027;s interesting to learn something about your heritage, like I did, but it is a waste of money. I could have invested in a fun experience instead.</p>
<p>
<span class="paranum">4</span> In addition, scientists are not <span class="highlight">confident</span> in the results, which are too simple. Scientists argue that test results do not show definite answers. So, think twice before you send your DNA to a test site. It may tell you that your ancestors may or may not have lived in Ivory Coast at one time. But it won&#x0027;t reveal everything that makes you so awesome!</p>
